        <p>At <strong>UniQEd</strong>, we believe every student deserves a personalized and supportive learning environment that adapts to their unique strengths, challenges, and interests. Our platform is designed to empower neurodiverse students—those with ADHD, dyslexia, autism, and other learning differences—by providing tailored educational tools and resources that fit their individual learning styles.</p>

        <p>We understand that no two students are the same, which is why our adaptive learning system uses innovative technologies to create personalized pathways for each learner. Whether a student excels through visual aids, interactive exercises, or self-paced learning modules, our platform adjusts to meet those preferences.</p>
